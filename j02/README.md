# My experience Learning Video Editing software

## Adobe Premiere
I had always sort of wanted to get some experience with video editing, the only time I have done anything of the sort was for various school projects that required a video, however those I did a single take and threw into windows movie maker. I would like to learn Adobe Premiere while I still get it for free through CSU Chico as a student.

## My Plan going in
I just wanted to get a good grip on the features available to me, and put together a video using them. I found a bunch of old clips of video games I had recorded and so I will try to edit them together into a short fun video for myself

## Starting my first project
I downloaded adobe premiere and when I first opened it I was greeted with a page detailing the many features available

I clicked through all the features and was presented with a prompt to start my first project. I clicked the create new project button and was presented with some preset video clips to use for tutorial purposes. I saw that on the left it had all my files of my machine so I went to my clips section I had and selected a couple of clips to make a video.

Once i had the clips selected I clicked create and I was greeted by my first project with all my selected clips in the bottom left of my screen, some tutorial options on the left, and a preview+audio tracks as the main part of the screen.

My next play was to edit some of my clips. I wanted to cut out a bunch of the screentime when I was not doing anything interesting in the footage, So I went to the sidebar thats next to the video segments on the bottom of the screen and clicked on the Razor because to me that was the thing that seemed closest to a cut tool. When I clicked on the middle of the footage it then split the video into 2 different pieces. I was then able to select the just the first bit that I wanted to cut out.

Then I wanted that to delete the first chunk I selected. So my first thought was to select it and click the delete button on my keyboard and it worked exactly as I hoped it would function. I had now successfully selected and edited out some of the footage.

I then continued to cut out other bits I did not want in my video until I decided that I wanted to make a title screen for the start of my video. I clicked on the import in the top left hand side of the screen and this time I went into my photos folder and selected a random picture that I could use for the titlescreen still of my video. I imported the photo and it showed up in the bottom left of my screen and on the left upper screen but not in the actual video when I clicked play. I then right clicked on the photo and saw there was an option "Insert" which I clicked and it was added to my video. I then dragged the rest of the footage to line up and play after.
