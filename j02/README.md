# My experience Learning Video Editing software
By: Lukas Pecson 12/7/22

## Adobe Premiere
I had always sort of wanted to get some experience with video editing, the only time I have done anything of the sort was for various school projects that required a video, however those I did a single take and threw into windows movie maker. I would like to learn Adobe Premiere while I still get it for free through CSU Chico as a student.
